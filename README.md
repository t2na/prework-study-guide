# <Bootcamp Pre-Work Study Guide>

## Description

The following is a study guide that I made to be used for new students who are signing up for UC Berkeley's coding bootcamp. I made this project for two reasons: 1. is to test and learn new skills as a developer, such as those related to different programming langauges, and 2. was for new students to take notes as they progress through the course. The study guide allows students to keep notes on the topics they learn through the course, while also providing a living document online that they can access through their browser. I ultimately learned the first steps to many new concepts, like the differentiation between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Installation

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

The Pre-Work Study Guide is used by accessing it through a browser, and looking through the notes that are listed on the page. Additionally, you can open the console in the developer tools section of chrome/chromium and see the JavaScript running, which will randomly pick a topic for you to study!

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
